# finance.py 
Just a simple Python script to calculate my own finances for each month from an imported CSV file. 


## Why don't you just use Mint? 
Because sometimes they get my categories wrong, which is annoying. And also because I have nothing to do on Sunday. 

## Will this help control my spending?
Probably not. It just makes me feel guilty looking at the $115 I spend on Uber this year, but in the end I am too lazy to walk to the bus stop anyway.
